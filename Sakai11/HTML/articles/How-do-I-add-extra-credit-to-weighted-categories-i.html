      </div>

            <div id="article-description">
        <p>The Gradebook2 tool does not allow scores above the maximum value. For instance, if grading by Points, and the maximum point value is set to 150, you cannot assign a score of 155 points. If grading by percentages, you cannot assign a score of 105%.  If grading by letter grade, you cannot assign a score of A++.</p>
<p>Some instructors may want to award extra credit either as an addition to an existing grade or as a separate extra credit assignment. </p>
<p>The method of adding extra credit is slightly different depending on whether the gradebook is &quot;non-weighted&quot;, &quot;non-weighted categories&quot; or &quot;weighted categories&quot; </p>
<p>It is also slightly dependent on whether the gradebook is scored by &quot;points&quot;, &quot;percentages&quot; or &quot;letter grades&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>In all instances of adding extra credit, it is important to look at the total number of possible points that can be awarded for the semester to a student and base your extra credit calculations on how will it affect the final Course Grade.</strong></p>
<p>This becomes a bit more complex when working with a weighted categories gradebook because instructors have the option to add an extra credit <strong>item</strong> to an existing category (which affectes to overall grade only as much as the weighted category affects the overall grade) or they can add an &quot;weighted&quot; Extra Credit <strong>category</strong> and place extra credit items within it (which will affect the overall grade only as much as the extra credit weighted category affects the overall grade).</p>
